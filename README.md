# DSA-Analysis-and-Design
Reflection
Throughout this course, I tackled two core problems that deepened my understanding of data structures and algorithms. In Project One, I analyzed the run-time and memory efficiency of different data structures such as arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, and hash maps. The goal was to determine which structures were best suited for specific tasks based on performance trade-offs. In Project Two, I implemented a sorting algorithm to organize a list of Computer Science courses in alphanumeric order, reinforcing my grasp of algorithmic logic and practical coding skills.

To approach these problems, I began by reviewing the theoretical foundations of each data structure and algorithm. I then applied this knowledge to real-world scenarios, testing and comparing performance metrics. Understanding data structures is crucial because they directly impact the efficiency, scalability, and reliability of software systems. Choosing the right structure can mean the difference between a program that runs smoothly and one that struggles under load.

I encountered several roadblocks during these projects, particularly when debugging sorting logic and optimizing memory usage. I overcame these challenges by breaking down the problem into smaller components, using visualization tools to trace execution, and consulting documentation and peer discussions to clarify concepts. These strategies helped me build resilience and sharpen my problem-solving skills.

Working on these projects has expanded my approach to software design by emphasizing the importance of planning and analysis before coding. I now consider performance implications early in the development process and strive to write code that is not only functional but also efficient.

Finally, this experience has evolved the way I write programs to be more maintainable, readable, and adaptable. I’ve adopted clearer naming conventions, modular design principles, and thorough documentation practices. These habits ensure that my code can be easily understood and modified by others—or by myself in the future.
